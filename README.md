# PDF-Password-Protection
PDF password protection is a way to secure a PDF document by requiring a password to open or perform certain actions on the file. There are two main types of passwords:

User Password: This is the password required to open and view the document.
Owner Password: This is for the document owner and allows them to modify permissions, such as printing or copying the content.
